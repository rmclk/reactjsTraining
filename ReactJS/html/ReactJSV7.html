                        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
                        Design simple views for each state in your application,
                        and React will efficiently update and render just the
                        right components when your data changes.

                        Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>

                        <h2>Component-Based</h2>
                        Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose
                        them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript
                        instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app
                        and keep state out of the DOM.</p>

                        pattern. In Ember.js, route is used as model, handlebar template as view

                    <p><h2>Meteor</h2>
                        Meteor.js is a cohesive development platform, a collection of libraries
                        and packages that are bound together in a tidy way to make web development easier.
                        It builds on ideas from previous frameworks and libraries to offer an easy way
                        to start a prototype app, but it gives you the tools and flexibility to build a
                        full fledged production app. There are libraries like Tracker and Blaze that the
                        Meteor Development Group has built specifically for a reactive front-end experience.</p>

                    <p>
                        <h2>Why is Meteor good?</h2>
                        Meteor is a reactive, full stack JavaScript framework that allows developers to write single
                        page apps for desktop and mobile. Simply put, Meteor is a collection of tools that developers
                        use to write web apps that are fast and secure.

                        The core concept of Meteor is reactivity. Real time syncing of data is built into Meteor at
                        the core, but it does it in a different way. Instead of polling the server for updates every
                        few seconds, a Meteor app maintains a low-data connection to a server using a protocol called DDP.
                        DDP allows the server to send data to the client the instant it changes, since it had a continuous
                        connection with it. Reactivity encompasses more than this, though. When a client changes a piece
                        of data, Meteor renders the required UI change before the data gets sent to the server. This means
                        that changes seem to happen instantly, as the app doesn't have to wait for a round trip to the
                        server to complete.

                        Meteor has a ton of other cool things, like a templating system called Blaze, a database on the
                        client called Minimongo, and more. If you really are interested in learning Meteor, a book called
                        Disover Meteor, at discovermeteor.com, is definitely the way to go. It teaches everything you
                        need to know about Meteor, like routing, templating, subscriptions, publishing, and more, using
                        a real app that you build as the book progresses. It's a really, really good book and will help
                        you grasp the concepts of Meteor in only a few hours.
